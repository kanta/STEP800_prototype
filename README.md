8 axis stepper motor driver board which can control over Ethernet. The current firmware is based on [Open Sound Control](http://opensoundcontrol.org/) protocol.
[Arduino Zero](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/ArduinoZero) and official [Ethernet library](https://www.arduino.cc/en/reference/ethernet) compatible.

Stepper driver chips are STMicroelectronics's [L6470](https://www.st.com/en/motor-drivers/l6470.html) which provide most of functionalities as a stepper driver.
